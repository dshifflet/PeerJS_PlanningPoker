# Planning Poker over Peer.JS via WebRTC

* THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS *

## Usage
* Host it somewhere.
* Or download it and node start or nodemon
* It will host the PeerJs and the static stuff via Express


## PROBLEMS
* Only works right with Firefox and Chrome
* If using Chrome keep the game in it's own window.  No neighbor tabs.  If you change focus to a tab in the same window the game is hosted in... You will not get updates.
